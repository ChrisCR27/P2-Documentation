## Introduction
The purpose for this guide is to inform individuals on how to operate a USB drive.

## What is a USB?
A Universal Serial Bus(USB) drive is a device that is used for storing data, and it includes an integrated USB interface along with flash memory.  Most drives are built to be removable, rewritable. compactable, durable and reliable. They tend to operate faster in large storage spaces, and are mechanically well made because no moving parts are included. When plugged into the USB port, they get power from the device to function. Other names for USB drive may also be flash drive or USB flash drive.
